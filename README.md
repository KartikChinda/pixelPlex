Welcome, to PixelPlex. 


- Using Stream because it is currently in use by Adobe, Soundcloud, Imgur etc. 

- Tech used: NextJs 14, Shadcn-UI, 

Steps: 
- Added routes and fixed folder structure by adding root and auth as the (grouped routes), meeting and [id] as the slug routes, and just adding normal pages. 

- Create components for the navbar and the sidebar, start working on those. 

- For the sidebar, create your constants folder and add all the links and the routes in an array there.
